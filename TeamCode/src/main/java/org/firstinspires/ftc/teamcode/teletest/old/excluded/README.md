These files depend on old and/or season-specific code that is no longer built!
Because of this, these OpModes have also been excluded from the build.
If you need them, you'll need to go to the TeamCode build.gradle and comment out the exclude lines for these as well as their dependencies.
Also, if an old TeleTest dies and you don't care to fix it, drag it into this folder and the problem will just magically disappear.

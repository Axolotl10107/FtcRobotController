A Methods Library provides implementations of methods to set the controls state's setters.
The code generator will string these together into the generated state. Not all Method Libraries need to implement all Setters, but all Setters for the selected Season need to be implemented by Methods. It can be covered by multiple Method Libraries.
Use Expander tags to get the code lines from Actions that Primitives are mapped to. More details on this a little later.

The "Bases" and "Extensions" lists declare the Action Libraries that your Method Library depends on.

"strafer.json" serves as a good example of how to create a Method Library.
